## Summary
This machine learning model uses baseline demographic, clinical, microbiological, as well as treatment-related features to estimate the clinical periodontal treatment endpoint [(Feres et al., 2020)][1]. The model was trained using a South American set of raw data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and externally tested using a North American/European set of raw RCT data.

## Datasets
To maintain patient privacy, synthetic datasets have been created from the original South American as well as North American/European datasets. The synthetic datasets were created using the [CTGAN Synthesizer][2].
