## Summary
This machine learning model uses baseline demographic, clinical, microbiological, as well as treatment-related features to estimate the clinical periodontal treatment endpoint, defined as having at most four sites with probing depth of 5 mm or more, one year following treatment. The model was trained using a South American set of raw data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and externally tested using a North American/European set of raw RCT data.

## Datasets
To maintain patient privacy, synthetic datasets have been created from the original South American as well as North American/European datasets. The synthetic datasets were created using the [CTGAN Synthesizer]([https://eff.org](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/modeling/synthesizers/ctgansynthesizer).
